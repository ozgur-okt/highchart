# Highcharts Bar Chart with Target Values

This repository contains a React component that renders a bar chart using the Highcharts library. The chart visualizes data with associated target values, providing insights into how well the values match their targets.

## Features
### 1. Data Visualization
The main feature of this chart is its ability to visually represent data using bars. Each bar corresponds to a specific data point and indicates its value. The height of the bar is proportional to the value it represents.

### 2. Target Line
In addition to the data bars, the chart includes a target line. This line represents the desired target value for each data point. The target line is displayed as an orange line, making it easy to distinguish from the data bars.

### 3. Data with Status
The chart provides a clear indication of whether each data point has reached its target or not. Data points that have met or exceeded their target are highlighted in red, while those that have not reached their target are displayed in blue. This visual distinction helps users quickly assess the performance of each data point.

### 4. Interactive and Responsive
The chart is interactive, allowing users to hover over data points to view specific values. It's also responsive, adjusting its size and layout to fit various screen sizes and devices.
